### Create a program using python or C++ that accomplishes two things:

Asks a user whether they would like to output an exponential or uniform
distribution of random numbers ([random variate generation](https://www.acm-sigsim-mskr.org/Courseware/Balci/Slides/BalciSlides-14-ImplementationRVG.pdf))
([examples of how to fit your random number to a distribution](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/books/ftp/ch5f_slides.pdf)). The user will also specify the technique to generate the random numbers. The distribution generated must be output in a comma separated file and be between one and zero. You will turn in one comma separated file for each distribution.

Name the exponential distribution Lastname_Firstname_exponential.csv
Name the uniform distribution Lastname_firstname_uniform.csv
Use all the techniques below to generate the random numbers. You must  turn your code for each random number generator:
