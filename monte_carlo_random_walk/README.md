# Random Walk/Monte Carlo Simulation

Create a random walk program that tries to minimize the amount of money a user spends on Lyft.

Simulation is written in Python.

When we can walk for 6 block for free, and cost of transportation costs $10,
then, on average, the most amount of blocks you can walk with the least
amount of money seems to be 7 blocks with $867 or 9 blocks with $1636 for 20000
walks.
